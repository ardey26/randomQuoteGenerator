# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` to start!

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

This project of mine was made solely to put into use what I've learned in React in my first week of studies. I've learned how Babel reads syntax, and the nuance between regular HTML expressions and JSX expressions.
